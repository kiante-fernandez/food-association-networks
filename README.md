Preference-based decisions, like choosing what to eat, often depend on associations between the options. For example, when selecting a fruit basket for the holidays, the relations between fruits contribute to the overall attractiveness of a basket. However, quantifying the relations between options is a non-trivial task. Ideally, the relations between options should relate to how they’re organized in a person’s memory. In this poster, I introduce a novel approach that utilizes semantic network modeling to quantify relations between groups of food options. By extracting descriptive measures of network organization, I showcase how the structure of knowledge representations of preferences can produce behavioral phenomena like choice, response times, and similarity judgments. In this study our goals are </br>

1. to investigate a new application of modeling knowledge representations as networks to quantify relations, between groups of options within preferential decision-making </br>
2. to examine how the structure of knowledge representations of preferences produces behavioral phenomena like choice, response times, and similarity judgements </br>
